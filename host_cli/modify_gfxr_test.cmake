# Launches host_cli and uses it to process a gfxr file to create a modified one, then compares the result to a golden file.
#
# Designed for use with add_test() like so:
#
#   enable_testing()
#   add_test(NAME MyTest
#     COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} 
#     -DTEST_EXECUTABLE=$<TARGET_FILE:host_cli> 
#     -DTEST_NAME=MyTest -DINPUT_GFXR=my_capture.gfxr 
#     -DGOLDEN_FILE=my_capture_golden.gfxr
#     -DADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS="" 
#     -P ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/modify_gfxr_test.cmake
#   )
#
# TEST_EXECUTABLE will be run with INPUT_GFXR. The test will pass if TEST_EXECUTABLE returns 0 exit code and the contents of the output json match the contents of GOLDEN_FILE.
# TEST_NAME should match the NAME given to add_test(). This is mainly used to ensure that temp files are unique to the test (to support running tests in parallel).
# ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS will be passed to TEST_EXECUTABLE in addition to the normal command-line. This is where you can specify options and parameters.
