# RenderDoc In-Application API

Dive only needs the In-Application API header in order to build with support for RenderDoc capture. This shouldn't need to be updated very frequently since the API is versioned.

To update the header:

1. Clone RenderDoc
2. Copy `renderdoc/api/app/renderdoc_app.h` to this folder
3. Update `LICENSE` (if the license has changed)
